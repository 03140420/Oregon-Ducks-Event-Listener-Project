# Oregon-Ducks-Event-Listener-Project
Created an Oregon Ducks themed webpage that includes event-listeners
multiple animations on the same page, adding background image, adding and formatting font overlay on the background, and adding links to the helmet images so that when you click on each helmet, it opens a new image that contains information or well-known Oregon Duck comments.
The project still needs to have additions to the code in order to get the linked images to close so the user can return to the home page (autzen stadium/helmets) page.
